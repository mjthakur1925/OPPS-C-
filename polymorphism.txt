The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the 
ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Compile time polymorphism: The overloaded functions are invoked by matching the type and number of arguments. 
This information is available at the compile time and, therefore, compiler selects the appropriate function at the compile time. 
It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading which is also known as static binding or early binding. 
Now, let's consider the case where function name and prototype is same.


Run time polymorphism: Run time polymorphism is achieved when the object's method is invoked at the run time instead of compile time.
It is achieved by method overriding which is also known as dynamic binding or late binding.
